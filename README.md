I've been trying to setup a workflow where I can debug mocha-tests against NodeJS server API written in ES6, however the breakpoint seems not matching with the lines of code at all.

# Steps to reproduce:
1. npm install
2. put a breakpoint in the test.js
3. run the mocha debug to let the breakpoint hit,and track.
